# Absence of Rational Bubbles in NFTs

This repository is part of a research project focused on **replicating and extending** the tests conducted in my first paper:

**[Absence of Rational Bubbles in NFTs: An Analysis based on the Hypothesis of Non-stationarity](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380376110_Absence_of_Rational_Bubbles_in_NFTs_An_Analysis_based_on_the_Hypothesis_of_Non-stationarity)**

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to **re-run and improve the statistical tests** used in the article by implementing a more robust approach to missing data imputation and refining time series preprocessing. Specifically, the project:

- Replicates **ADF** and **KPSS** stationarity tests on NFT-related token price series;
- Applies **advanced missing data imputation techniques**;
- Provides clean and organized datasets for further analysis.

## Findings
The results remain consistent with the original study:

The tests continue to indicate the absence of rational bubbles in NFT-related assets.

This suggests that although price patterns may resemble bubbles, they are not driven by rational speculative behavior typically associated with fundamental mispricing. Instead, the dynamics observed may reflect irrational or speculative bubbles, possibly linked to the behavior and expectations of NFT investors.

These findings reinforce the notion that the NFT market may be influenced more by market sentiment and hype than by traditional financial fundamentals.
