## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to **re-run and improve the statistical tests** used in the article by implementing a more robust approach to missing data imputation and refining time series preprocessing. Specifically, the project:

- Replicates **ADF** and **KPSS** stationarity tests on NFT-related token price series;
- Applies **advanced missing data imputation techniques**;
- Provides clean and organized datasets for further analysis.
